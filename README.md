# Food Trakker

The idea for Food Trakker came about when we realized that there was a lack of good tools for tracking Food Trucks. We wanted to create an app that would be easy to use and would help people find their favourite Food Trucks and food festivals in one dedicated app.

## Project

Food Trakker is a web-based application created by a group of 4 junior software developers who wanted to display their skills in programming by creating this application as a portfolio project. We are constantly working on improving Food Trakker and adding new features. If you have any suggestions, we would love to hear them!
